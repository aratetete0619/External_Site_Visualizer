## Architecture

The workflow of the application is as follows:

1. **User Interaction**: When a user conducts a search, that request is sent to the backend via a GraphQL API.

2. **Data Retrieval and Analysis**: An Amazon EC2 instance crawls the specified web pages. It uses spaCy and GINZA to extract entities and their relationships from the text.

3. **Data Storage and Indexing**: The extracted information is stored in Neo4j and Elasticsearch indexes the newly extracted information.

4. **Data Searching and Retrieval**: When a user searches for a specific entity or relationship, the GraphQL API sends the appropriate search query to Elasticsearch.

5. **Graph Generation**: Relationships between entities are dynamically drawn using React.js.

6. **Predicting with Machine Learning**: Amazon SageMaker is used to predict new relationships between entities.(In progress)

7. **Feedback and Improvement**: User feedback is stored in Mysql and used to improve the system.

8. **Monitoring**: The operation of Elasticsearch is monitored with Kibana.(In progress)

9. **Sharing**: Users can share search results on social media.(In progress)
